Import PDF vector geometry as native editable SketchUp edges with arc reconstruction, color-based tag grouping, text import, dash patterns, Scale by Reference tool, and full Bezier support. Pure-Ruby PDF parser -- no external dependencies.

---

## Overview

PDF Vector Importer parses PDF content streams directly in Ruby and reconstructs vector geometry as native SketchUp edges. No gems, no external binaries, no C extensions. It runs on every platform SketchUp supports, from 2017 Make (Ruby 2.2) through the current Pro release.

The importer profiles each PDF document to identify its origin (fabrication drawings, CAD exports, architectural plans, vector art, or raster scans) and adapts its import strategy accordingly.

## Key Features

- **Pure-Ruby PDF parser** -- no gems or external dependencies required
- **Adaptive Bezier subdivision** with configurable flatness tolerance
- **Kasa algebraic circle fitting** for arc reconstruction from point sequences
- **OCG layer support** -- PDF Optional Content Groups map to SketchUp Tags
- **Color-based tag grouping** with dash pattern mapping
- **Scale by Reference** tool -- select an edge, type the real-world dimension
- **Quick Scale** with 15 architectural/engineering presets
- **Architectural scale notation parsing** (1/4"=1'-0", 3/8"=1', etc.)
- **Text import** as geometry or labels
- **Raster fallback** for scanned pages
- **Import quality assessment** with warnings and performance metrics
- **Post-import action workflow** (geometry only, scale, cleanup, feature inventory)
- **Tag visibility controls** for PDF layers
- **Document profiling** (fabrication, CAD, architectural, vector art, raster)
- **FlateDecode decompression** for compressed PDF streams
- **Form XObject recursion** for embedded PDF forms

## Installation

1. Download `bc_pdf_vector_importer_v350.rbz`
2. In SketchUp: **Window > Extension Manager > Install Extension**
3. Select the `.rbz` file
4. Restart SketchUp if prompted

The extension registers under **File > Import** and adds a PDF Vector Importer toolbar.

## Scale Tool

The Scale by Reference tool lets you correct imported geometry to real-world dimensions. Select any edge, type the known real dimension, and all imported geometry scales proportionally.

### Quick Scale Presets

The Quick Scale dialog provides 15 architectural and engineering presets:

| Preset | Scale Ratio | Factor | Common Use |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1:1 | Full size | 1.0 | Detail drawings |
| 1:2 | Half size | 0.5 | Large details |
| 1:4 | Quarter size | 0.25 | Construction details |
| 1:5 | 1/5 size | 0.2 | Detail drawings (metric) |
| 1:8 | 1/8 size | 0.125 | Room plans |
| 1:10 | 1/10 size | 0.1 | Detailed plans (metric) |
| 1:16 | 1/16 size | 0.0625 | Section drawings |
| 1:20 | 1/20 size | 0.05 | Building plans (metric) |
| 1:24 | 1/24 size | 0.04167 | 1/2"=1'-0" plans |
| 1:48 | 1/48 size | 0.02083 | 1/4"=1'-0" plans |
| 1:50 | 1/50 size | 0.02 | General plans (metric) |
| 1:96 | 1/96 size | 0.01042 | 1/8"=1'-0" plans |
| 1:100 | 1/100 size | 0.01 | Site plans (metric) |
| 1:192 | 1/192 size | 0.00521 | 1/16"=1'-0" plans |
| 1:200 | 1/200 size | 0.005 | Site plans (metric) |

The tool also accepts freeform architectural notation such as `1/4"=1'-0"`, `3/8"=1'`, `1"=10'`, and similar formats.

## Import Report

After every import, the extension presents a quality assessment report with three sections:

### Quality Assessment

Each import receives a quality grade based on geometry fidelity:

- **Excellent** -- All vectors parsed, arcs reconstructed, no anomalies
- **Good** -- Minor issues (small gaps, unclosed paths) that do not affect usability
- **Fair** -- Some geometry lost or degraded; manual review recommended
- **Poor** -- Significant parsing failures; consider alternate export settings

### Warnings

The report flags common issues:

- Clipping paths that may hide geometry
- Extremely thin or zero-width strokes
- Unsupported blend modes or transparency
- Font-based geometry that could not be converted
- Coordinate values outside the SketchUp modeling range
- Pages with no extractable vector content (raster-only)

### Performance Metrics

Every import logs timing and throughput data:

- Total import time (seconds)
- Objects imported (edges, arcs, faces)
- Throughput (objects/sec)
- PDF stream decompression time
- Bezier subdivision iterations
- Arc fitting attempts and successes

---

## Document Profiling

The importer analyzes each PDF and classifies it into one of five categories to optimize parsing:

| Profile | Characteristics |
|---------|----------------|
| **Fabrication** | Shop drawings, cut lists, weld callouts, BOM tables |
| **CAD** | Exported from AutoCAD, Revit, SolidWorks, or similar |
| **Architectural** | Floor plans, elevations, sections with dimension strings |
| **Vector Art** | Illustrator/Inkscape artwork, logos, complex fills |
| **Raster** | Scanned documents with embedded images, minimal vectors |
